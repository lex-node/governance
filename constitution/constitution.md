[DRAFTING NOTES:

    1. waiting for feedback from team, btu I likely need to revise the new  code deference provisions re: Council smart contract since they are currently using rinkleby smart contract with manual approval of vote minting, etc.; possibly will bifurcate between current and future arrangement and provide code-deference structure for the latter that kicks in if/when activated by council 

    2. fix clause / section numbering periodically

    3. each counil voter should be deemed to be making certain reps, warranties and covenants (e.g., that they own the POKT for the governance stake or are duly authorized by whoever does own the POKT to vote on such owner's behalf, that they are not OFAC SDN list, etc.)

    4. should have section on nodes and providing that persons operating nodes consent to being slashed (can also later repurpose some of that language re: slashing for Constitutional violations if that eventually becomes a thing)

    5. discuss/research possibilities re: Council as unincorporated nonprofit association and best jurisdiction (some U.S. states provide limited liability for members of such an association)

    6. get feedback from team re: what happens with voting tokens when a governance stake that formerly satisfied criteria for minting voting tokens beome un-satisfied (e.g., due to large aggregate council-wide governance stake increase after voting tokens minted on basis of lower aggregate governance stake)

# THE POCKET NETWORK CONSTITUTION

This Pocket Network Constitution (this **Constitution** ) is a legally binding agreement governing the Pocket Network and Pocket Blockchain and the use of the Pocket Technologies in connection therewith. 

# Mission Statement

We, the Contributors to Pocket Network and Pocket Technologies, are united together in the mission to build censorship-resistant technology that will lay the foundation for reorganizing the world’s institutions towards a more equitable, hyper-connected, interplanetary future.

# Principles

1. **Credible Neutrality:** No one User should be favored over any other within their demographic. For example, Protocol Upgrades which favor Nodes over Apps are neutral, but Protocol Upgrades which favor specific App types (e.g. exchanges) or specific Apps (e.g. Binance) are not neutral.
2. **Sustainable Decentralization:** The Pocket Network should optimize for as many unaffiliated and autonomous Nodes as possible, because this reinforces the resilience and censorship-resistance of the service, but this should not be rushed at the cost of the sustainable growth of Pocket Network.
3. **User-Centrism:** The Pocket Network is specialized to provide reliable decentralized infrastructure to Users. We must therefore continue to optimize for 1) User adoption and 2) the qualities that contribute to reliable infrastructure: network redundancy, robust data integrity, data sovereignty, minimal latency, minimal downtime, and minimalist engineering.
4. **Freedom of Movement:** The Pocket Network should be accessible to both Apps and Nodes. Equally, all Pocket Network stakeholders or participants should enjoy the right to exit.
5. **Optionality:** Operating a Node should incur no more costs than the cost of operation. All other responsibilities, e.g. participation in the Council, should be optional.
6. **Agnosticism:** Pocket Network should maintain neutrality as a middleware protocol. While the governance of Pocket Network may be reliant from time to time on other networks or tools, the system itself should retain a level of modularity that facilitates switching out components with minimal friction.
7. **Cross-Chain Diplomacy:** The Pocket Protocol is a middleware protocol, which means our community members will come from a wide range of blockchain communities. DAO participants should leave tribalism at the door: i.e., they should refrain from engaging in political debates that are not directly relevant to improving the Pocket Technologies, Pocket Protocol or Pocket Network.
8. **Consensual Collaboration:** While the Pocket Network Council is relatively permissionless, this does not mean anyone is entitled to work. Proposals will be assessed on their merits alone, including Contributors’ fitness to fulfill the proposal. Likewise, Contributors are not required to let any other Contributor work with them, unless the Council has approved a proposal to that effect.

* The Principles are ranked in order of priority.
* Decisions [of???] must be made according to their furtherance of the Principles. 
* When deciding between alternatives, these alternatives shall be prioritized according to the ordering of the Principles listed above, with higher-ranking Principles to always take priority over lower-ranking Principles. 
* Lower-ranking Principles should only be sacrificed in favor of higher-ranking Principles if a Pareto optimal state has been achieved, i.e. it is not possible to improve one Principle without making another Principle worse off. Until then, the Council shall seek to make only Pareto improvements, where Principles are improved without making any other Principles worse off.3
* Once it is no longer possible to optimize any Principle without sacrificing another, this Constitution should be amended to introduce minimum satisfaction thresholds on each Principle.
* Stakeholder rights at any given moment, as defined by the values of On-Chain parameters, may justifiably be sacrificed in the furtherance of the Principles, because it is intended that the Principles, if achieved, will ensure maximum utility to maximum stakeholders.
* The Principles should be designed, in all future iterations of this Constitution, to optimally achieve the mission of the Pocket Technologies and Pocket Network stated under "Mission Statement" above.

# Articles



## 4. Pocket Network Governance

4.1. Governance of the Pocket Network is an emergent phenomenon arising from the decisionmaking and activities of a variety of User demographics and other Persons, including: 
* the Pocket Network Foundation;
* the Pocket Network Council and Council Voters; 
* the Pocket Development Company and other developers of Pocket Core and other Pocket Technologies; 
* POKT holders; and
* Node operators.

### Legislature / Council

#### Nature & Functions of Council

4.2. The legislative function of the Pocket Network is performed by the Pocket Network Council, which is the unincorporated nonprofit association of Council members [NOTE TO DRAFT: DISCUSS "UNINCORPORATED NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION" & JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES]. The Council: (a) monitors, supervises and governs the Foundation, as further set forth in Article [] hereof; (b) holds and governs the Council Development Fund, which is the aggregate of all unspent POKT DevFund Awards allocated from POKT Block Awards; and (c) considers, holds votes with respect to and approves or denies Pocket Improvement Proposals (PIPs), Pocket Ecosystem Proposals (PEPs) and Parameter Update Proposals (PUPs). 

#### Council Smart Contract

4.3 Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution in connection with a Material Adverse Exception Event, the Council and Council members shall utilize the Council Smart Contract as the exclusive method of: (a) holding and governing the Council Development Fund, (b) admitting and expelling Council members, (c) accepting and activating Governance Stakes, (d) minting and revoking Voting Tokens and (e) holding votes with respect to and approving or denying PIPs, PEPs, PUPs and proposals relating to the Foundation. The Council may also utilize the Council Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving the Counncil. 

4.4 Except as otherwise provided in this Constitution in connection with a Material Adverse Exception Event, among the Council members, the results of operation of the Council Smart Contract shall be determinative of the rights and obligations of, and shall be final, binding upon and not permitted to be contested or disputed by, the Council and each of the Council members with respect to the Council and all matters relating to the Council or the Council members in their capacities as such, and shall not be contested (in a Legal Proceeding or otherwise) by any of them. The immediately preceding sentence shall not prohibit or limit any Legal Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Council or any Council member(s) (the **Plaintiff(s)**) against the Council, any other Council member(s) or any other Person(s) (the **Defendant(s)**) to the extent that: 
    (a)	a prohibition or limitation of such Legal Proceeding would be illegal or unenforceable under any applicable law; or
    (b)	such Legal Proceeding: 
        (i)	is based on or arises from a Material Adverse Exception Event that either: 
            (A)	resulted directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from the fraud, willful misconduct or knowing violation of any applicable Legal Requirement or applicable Order by the Defendant(s); or 
            (B)	resulted directly ro indirectly in an improper personal benefit to the Defendant(s); and
        (ii) Plaintiff(s) suffered or incurred Damages as a result of such Material Adverse Exception Event.
        
The provisions of this Article 4.4 shall continue to apply to a Person who was a Council member after such Person is no longer a Member.

4.5  The following are Material Adverse Exception Events (**MAEEs**):
    
    (a)	a Consensus Attack that adversely affects or could reasonably be expeted to adversely affect the results or operations of the Council Smart Contract;
    
    (b)	a change to the Council Blockchain (or node software client or network referenced in defining the Council Blockchain) that adversely affects or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the results or operations of the Council Blockchain or to result in a persistent contentious "hard fork” (as such term is commonly understood and used by software engineers expert in developing blockchain protocol software clients) of the Council Blockchain;
    
    (c)	a “chain reorganization” (as such term is commonly understood and used by software engineers expert in developing blockchain protocol software clients) of the Council Blockchain that adversely affects or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the results or operations of the Council Smart Contract;
    
    (d)	the Council Smart Contract having become inoperable, inaccessible or unusable, or any tokens under the control of such Designated Smart Contract having become permanently “frozen,” “stuck” or non-transferable, including as the result of any code library or repository incorporated by reference into such Designated Smart Contract or any other smart contract or oracle on which such Designated Smart Contract depends in whole or in part having become inoperable, inaccessible or unusable or having itself suffered a Material Adverse Exception Event--without limiting the foregoing, a cirumstance shall be deemed “permanent” if such condition would persist except in the event of a hardfork or chain reorganization that is not reasonably expected to occur in the near future;
    
    (e)	a material adverse effect on the use, functionality or performance of the Council Smart Contract as the result of a clear and manifest bug, defect or error in the source code of the Designated Smart Contract or a clear and manifest bug, defect or error in the compilation of such source code to bytecode, in each case, as evidenced by the failure of the Council Smart Contract to function in accordance with provisions of this Constitution that expressly pertain to the Council Smart Contract or by documentation or other evidence prepared contemporaneously with the Council Smart Contract source code demonstrating that the intended functioning of the Council Smart Contract differs materially from the actual functioning of the Council Smart Contract as a result of such bug, defect or error;
    
    (f)	any unauthorized use of an administrative function or privilege of the Council Smart Contract, including: (1) any use of any administrative credential, key, password, account or address by a Person who has misappropriated or gained unauthorized access to such administrative credential, key, password, account or address or (2) any unauthorized use of an administrative function or privilege by a Person who ordinarily is authorized to use such administrative function or privilege but in a single instance or series of instance exceeds such Person’s authority to use such administrative function or privilege; or

    (g)	
        (i) (A) the Council Smart Contract or any of Governance Stake or Council Development Fund or any other tokens held in or controlled by the Council Smart Contract becomes subject to an Order or applicable Legal Requirement that permanently or temporarily prohibits or restrains the Council Smart Contract (or that, if the Council Smart Contract were a Person, would prohibit or restrain the Council Smart Contract) from executing any function or operation it would otherwise reasonably be expected to execute in accordance with the Order or Legal Requirement or (B) permanently or temporarily orders or directs the Council Smart Contract (or that, if the Council Smart Contract were a Person, would order or direct the Council Smart Contract) to take an action or bring about a circumstance it would otherwise not reasonably be expected to take or bring about in accordance with the Order or Legal Requirement; or 
        
        (ii) the Council or any Council member becomes subject to an Order or applicable Legal Requirement requiring the Council or such Council member to cause the Council Smart contract to take or refrain from taking any action or requiring the Council or such Council member to take or refrain from taking any action with respect to any Governance Stake, Council Development Fund or other tokens held in or controlled by the Council Smart Contract, in each case, which it is not within the power of the Council or such Council member to comply with due to features of the Council Smart Contract or the Council Smart Contract Blockchain (alone or in combination with any other event or circumstance).

#### Council Membership

4.4. A Person shall be deemed to be a Council member if and only if such Person is a Voter. 

4.5. A Person shall be deemed a Voter if and only if: (a) such Person has deposited POKT into the Council Smart Contract to create a Governance Stake; (b) such Governance Stake is active; and (c) such Person has minted and continues to hold and control one or more Voting Tokens with respect to such Governance Stake. 

4.6. The Governance Stake of a Person shall be deemed active if and only if: 
    (a) the Maturation Period with respect to such Governance Stake has elapsed; and 
    (b) at least one of the following conditions precedent is satisfied with respect thereto:
        (i) Such Person is a **Trusted Account Holder** (i.e., such Person has achieved [(and at each relevant time, maintains)] an Elite level in the Pocket Community Game or has been vouched for by a Champion [(which voucher has not been revoked)]); or
        (ii) such Governance Stake is a **Trust-Minimized Stake** (i.e., [at each relevant time,] such Governance Stake comprises a number of POKT at least equal to (A) the total aggregate number of POKT on deposit in the On-Chain DAO Treasury (or the relevant temporary trust, if applicable) with respect to whi]ch Voting Tokens have been minted and remain outstanding at such time; divided by (B) the number of Voters at such time). 

        [NOTE TO SELF/DRAFT: what happens if someone holds Voting Tokens and their Governance Stake subsequently becomes 'inactive' (e.g., due to staked POKT dipping below the variable trust-minimization threhold)?]

4.7. POKT comprising: (a) an active Governance Stake that has not been promptly utilized to mint Voting Tokens; or (b) a Governance Stake that has not promptly been activated may, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Council, be deemed abandoned. In the sole and absolute discretion of the Council, POKT deemed to be abandoned may be: (i) returned to the depositing address (less applicable transaction fees and setoffs, if any); (ii) treated in accordace with any applicable laws of property escheatment; (iii) left indefinintely in the Council Smart Contract; or (iv) treated in any other manner that does not violate this Constitution or applicable law. 

4.8. Each Council member shall vote his, her or its Voting Shares and otherwise exercise the rights, powers and perquisites of a Council member on a reasonably informed basis and in good faith, taking into account the Pocket Principles. Each Council member shall not sell his, her or its Voting Shares or any of the other rights, powers and perquisites of being a Council member or accept any compensation, reward, reimbursement or incentive for voting such Council Member's Voting Shares or using such rights, powers and perquisites. 

4.9. Additional fees, staking requirements or other conditions or obligations of Council membership may be approved by the Council at any time, such as in connection with Aragon Agreements.

#### Council Proposals

4.10. Proposals to be voted upon by the Council must be submitted solely by Council members. The immediately preceding sentence shall not be deemed to limit the right, power or discretion of a Council member to submit such a proposal on behalf of or in cooperation with another User or User demographic, provided that such Council member independently supports such proposal on its own merits without regard to any personal or business-related affiliation or pecuniary gain with respect to such other User(s) or such proposal and has not breached Article 4.8. 


#### Removing Voters

4.11. Voters can be removed by the Council for 5 violations of this Constitution. A Voter’s violation count is inclusive of:
  * **settlements** = 0.5 violations
  * **lost Aragon Court rulings** = 1 violation
  * **violation of Principles** = 2 violations, where an action will qualify as violating the Principles if it is successfully challenged on such grounds by any other member of the Council using Aragon Agreements, and a vote in favor of an action will retroactively qualify as violating the Principles if deemed so by Supermajority Approval in a Signaling Vote.

4.12. Voters who were removed pursuant to the preceding Article 4.11 will not be permitted to re-join unless they first successfully achieve Supermajority Approval in a Signaling Vote.

#### Right to Exit

4.13. While the barrier to entering the Council is intended to provide a robust defense against time-based attack vectors such as vote renting, the barrier to exit is intentionally minimal. Any Voter can exit the Council at any time by burning their Voting Token, unless a proposal to burn their token is already pending.

#### Redeeming/Burning Governance Stakes

4.14. If a Voter burns their own token, their Governance Stake will be redeemed; if a Voter has their token burned by the Council, their Governance Stake will be forfeited (burned).

4.15. Whichever account has the On-Chain DAO Treasury permissions will be responsible for executing redemptions/burning.

### Executive / Foundationn

#### Pocket Network Foundation (Foundation)

##### The Role of the Foundation

4.16. The Foundation's objectives are to:
  * Steward the Pocket Technologies and Pocket Network, including Pocket Core
  * Request funds from the Council for specific projects that have strategic value to the Pocket Technologies or Pocket Network ecosystem, by submitting PEPs.

##### The Council’s Control of the Foundation

4.17. The Council's control of the Foundation is hard-coded into the Articles of Association of the Foundation, which separates the powers of all Foundation agents and defers those powers to the Council:
  * Directors/Supervisors are appointed/removed by each other on behalf of the Council
  * Directors must resign from other positions of authority in the Council (except Voter)
  * Supervisors ensure that Directors comply with the articles
  * No Supervisor decision is valid without Council approval.

4.18. New Directors/Supervisors will be appointed/removed according to PIPs approved by the Council.

##### Transparency

4.19. The Foundation's Articles compel the agents of the Foundation to give full notice to the Council concerning:
  * Any appointment/removal of Alternate Directors and/or Secretaries
  * Any resignations of Directors and/or Supervisors

##### Right to Refuse

4.20. The Directors and Supervisors of the Foundation can refuse the Council's decisions subject to the limitations imposed on them by the law and their duty to steward the Pocket Technologies and Pocket Network. If they refuse without cause, the Council may remove them.

##### Qualified Code Deference and the Foundation's Custodial Rights & Responsibilities

4.21. The Foundation shall serve as [a custodial] entity for Pocket Network, deferring decision-making to the Council in all cases except Material Adverse Exception Events (MAEEs), i.e. crises resulting from incomplete contracts and unforeseen events.

4.22.

4.23. If any User becomes aware that there is a MAEE, such User (the "Sending Party") shall deliver to the Foundation a notice (an "Exception Notice") signed by such User:
  * Certifying that the Sending Party believes in good faith that there is a MAEE;
  * Describing in reasonable detail the events, facts, circumstances and reasons forming the basis of such belief;
  * Containing a representation by the Sending Party, made to and for the benefit of the Foundation with the understanding that the Foundation will rely thereon, that, to the Sending Party’s knowledge, the certification and statements made pursuant to the preceding clauses are accurate as of the date of the Exception Notice, and, considered collectively, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make such statements, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

4.24. If the Foundation disputes the existence of a MAEE, then the Foundation shall promptly deliver a written notice of such non-acceptance, an "Exception Response Notice", to the Sending Party. The Exception Response Notice shall include the same categories of information, statements, evidence and representations and warranties as would be required for an Exception Notice, mutatis mutandis. The Sending Party may then lodge a complaint against the Foundation to the Cayman Island Summary Court. The decision resulting from the following court proceedings shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the Foundation and the Users of the Pocket Network.

4.25. If the Foundation agrees with the contents of the Exception Notice, upon receiving an Exception Notice, the Foundation shall deposit the DAO's funds into a multi-signature account owned by all of the Directors of the Foundation, to be treated, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, as a custodial trust held for the benefit of the DAO, until the Council enters into an Exception Handling Addendum.

4.25. After depositing the funds into the trust, the Foundation must then within 14 days (unless 4.22 applies) publish a planned response to the MAEE (an "Exception Handling Proposal"):
  * Describing in reasonable detail a proposal by the Foundation of the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought by the Users involved;
  * Including copies of any written evidence or other material written information, and summaries of any other evidence, relevant to, and material for the consideration of, the MAEE and the other matters referred to in the Exception Notice.

4.26. If the Foundation fears that details of the MAEE may be exploited and cause further harm to Users, they may do any of the following:
  * Publish their Exception Handling Proposal to a private channel containing only Voters;
  * Publish an Exception Handling Proposal that excludes exploitable details, to be followed by publication of such details only when the fix is ready to be deployed;
  * Secretly deploy fixes to the MAEE, only if such fixes do not amend Pocket Core’s consensus rules or undermine practical adherence to this Constitution, and under the understanding that such fixes may be replaced by the Council once the MAEE has been resolved.

4.27. The term "Exception Handling Addendum" refers to an addendum to this Constitution setting forth the agreement on the existence or non-existence of a MAEE and the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought in response thereto. An Exception Handling Proposal shall become an Exception Handling Addendum once the Council has signalled approval of the Proposal, represented by at least 50% of Stakeholders from the previous On-Chain DAO Treasury account depositing an equivalent Governance Stake into the custodial trust. Each Exception Handling Addendum shall automatically and without further action of the Council or Foundation be deemed incorporated into and to form a part of this Constitution.

4.28. Once the Foundation has executed on the Addendum and the MAEE is resolved, the Foundation shall return all funds in the custodial trust (including Governance Stakes) to a protocol-owned DAO account and reimburse duplicate Governance Stakes. If the Foundation neglects to return the funds within 14 days, any member of the Council may lodge a complaint against the Foundation to the Cayman Island Summary Court. The decision resulting from the following court proceedings shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the Foundation and the Users of the Pocket Network.

4.29. If the Council disputes the existence of a MAEE, or does not wish to accept all or any part of the Foundation's Exception Handling Proposal, then the Council may simply abstain from depositing a Governance Stake into the Foundation's custodial trust account. If after 14 days at least 50% of the Council has neglected to signal support of the Proposal, and the Foundation refuses to return the DAO's funds to the original account, any member of the Council may lodge a complaint against the Foundation to the Cayman Island Summary Court. The decision resulting from the following court proceedings shall be non-appealable, binding and conclusive upon the Foundation and the Users of the Pocket Network.

#### Access Control List (ACL)

##### Extensibility, Automation & the Signaling Era

4.30. The Foundation multi-sig will hold all ACL permissions at launch, but the Council may work to automate (and thus disintermediate) the Executive function by building a cross-chain integration between the Pocket Network and the Council's Aragon Agent (or a similar smart contract representative). The period before automatic cross-chain execution is achieved will be referred to as the Signaling Era.

##### Executive Veto During & After the Signaling Era

4.31. During the Signaling Era, the Foundation will retain a veto on all Governance Transactions as a failsafe. This veto falls within their Right to Refuse as part of their duty to steward the Pocket Network.

4.32. After the Signaling Era, the Foundation will still retain the right to veto (and the responsibility to sign) Governance Transactions that may involve parties who have not consented to this Constitution per ‘Informed Consent’. Before the Signaling Era officially ends, mechanisms must be developed that enable the Foundation to execute their custodial responsibilities in response to MAEEs, per ‘Qualified Code Deference and the Foundation's Custodial Rights & Responsibilities’.

##### Transaction Batching

4.33. By default, the Foundation will batch Governance Transactions on a weekly basis, unless an alternative schedule is specified in this Constitution.

### Judiciary

4.34. Any Voter can challenge actions, if they think the action violates this Constitution, and offer a settlement up to the amount staked by the proposer of the action. The proposer of the action can then choose to either accept the settlement, cancelling their action, or stake more collateral to raise a dispute. The outcome of disputes under this Judiciary function will be determined per ‘3. Arbitration’.

### Citizens

4.35. As the actors responsible for transaction finalization in Pocket Core, Validator Nodes have the power to overthrow the government apparatus of the Pocket Network (outlined as the above Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary functions). They are trusted to represent the citizenry (Users) of the Pocket Network because their Block Reward is tied directly to the number of relays being processed for developers (i.e. User usage). The Council must never approve Protocol Upgrades that would decouple this incentive alignment.

## 5. Liability

5.1. The Foundation is a distinct legal entity representing the DAO in all relationships with parties who have not consented to this Constitution. This means the DAO accepts no liability and all disputes, including claims of tort, must be directed to the Foundation.

5.2. Users shall be liable for losses caused by false or misleading attestations, such as fraudulent relay proofs, and shall forfeit any stake thereby according to the consensus rules of Pocket Core.

5.3. Software developers (such as the Pocket Development Company) are contracted by the Foundation on behalf of the DAO to develop Pocket Core. Because the Foundation defer to the Council, the Council is ultimately responsible for reviewing new software and approving Protocol Upgrades. Further, the Validator Nodes are responsible for accepting Protocol Upgrade Governance Transactions approved by the Council, and Users consent to the Validator Nodes'decisions through their use of the blockchain in accordance with Article 2.1. Therefore, the Users agree to hold software developers harmless for unintentional mistakes made in the expression of contractual intent, whether or not said mistakes were due to actual or perceived negligence.

## 6. Proposals

6.1. Proposers may initiate Signaling or Executive Votes for their proposal. They must specify which type of vote they are initiating.

6.2. Moderators may edit proposal forum posts only for the purpose of assigning numbers, categorizing, and updating the phases/statuses of proposals. Contractors of the Pocket Development Company will be the first Moderators, but anyone can apply to become a Moderator, or propose the removal of existing Moderators, by submitting a PIP.

### PIPs

6.3. PIPs will not be permissible if they contain multiple new specifications that could feasibly be divided into separate proposals without losing their meaning. This is in place to prevent omnibus proposals, whereby unpopular proposals are pushed through by bundling them with popular proposals.

6.4. PIP votes will last 7 days and pass with Majority Approval, unless otherwise specified in this Constitution (e.g. see Supermajority Approval requirement in ‘Constitutional Amendments’).

6.5. The execution of successful PIPs will be delayed by a period equal to the Unbonding Period plus one day, to give Bonded Users time to unbond and exit the network before the upgrade is executed, unless they are responses to MAEEs.

### PEPs

6.6. Where a PEP involves a transfer of funds, the threshold for PEP approval will be dynamic based on the budget of the proposal according to the parameters and formula of the Council’s Conviction Voting app(s).

6.7. Because the DAO is a non-profit multi-stakeholder organization, the Council shall only approve PEPs in the form of grants.

### PUPs

6.8. Off-chain parameters signaling the pricing preferences of the Council (the USDRelayTargetRange and the ReturnOnInvestmentTarget) will be governed using Conviction Signaling, whereby the Conviction-weighted average of all values will be submitted.

6.9. The following discretionary On-Chain parameters will be governed by the Foundation in order to fulfil the targets set by the Council in 6.8: BaseRelaysPerPOKT & StabilityAdjustment. The Foundation will anchor around the Council’s targets according to a 14-day average; if the actual relay price exceeds this target range temporarily, the Foundation can ignore it, but if the range is exceeded on average for 14 days, the Foundation must respond.

6.10. The SupportedBlockchains parameter will not be governed through voting, but instead according to the Network ID configuration choices of Voters. The Foundation will add Network IDs to the whitelist if 5% of Voters have configured their App or Node to include the Network ID. PUPs can still be submitted for this parameter to draw attention to new eligible Network IDs.

6.11. All other On-Chain parameters not specified above will be governed using Majority Approval, in votes lasting 7 days.

## 7. Finances

7.1. Contributors agree to pay taxes on all DAO-related income in whichever jurisdiction they reside. The DAO will not be held liable for any neglect in this matter.

7.2. The DAO will only accept incoming payments to its treasury in the form of Governance Stakes and the Pocket Network Block Reward.
For outgoing payments to recipients who may have not consented to this Constitution, the DAO will send funds piecemeal from the On-Chain DAO Treasury to the Foundation's On-Chain multi-signature wallet for specific PEPs.

7.3. It is forbidden to propose or approve unconditional general distributions of the On-Chain DAO Treasury to token holders, which may be misconstrued as dividends.

7.4. The Foundation may on the Council's behalf exchange POKT for another cryptocurrency or token for the purpose of using external blockchains.

## 8. Amendments

### Constitutional Amendments

8.1. This Constitution may be amended according to Majority Approval in the PIP process, unless otherwise specified in ‘Immutability’ and ‘Undo’ below.

#### Immutability

8.2. No Constitution amended to modify clauses or definitions marked with a ‡ will be accepted under any circumstance except per 8.6. 

8.3. Constitutions amended to introduce a ‡ will be accepted if they have first received Supermajority Approval by way of a Signaling Vote as part of the PIP process.

8.4. No Constitution amended to modify clauses or definitions marked with a †, or to introduce a †, will be accepted unless the proposed amendment has first received Supermajority Approval by way of a Signaling Vote as part of the PIP process.

8.5. For the avoidance of doubt, uploading the amended Constitution via the Aragon Agreements app initiates an Executive Vote, which will be rejected if not preceded by a successful Signaling Vote.

#### Undo

8.6. At any time, a supermajority vote may reverse the latest constitutional amendment (but no amendment that has been superseded by a new version). This "undo" mechanism shall prevail over the immutability mechanisms.

#### Executing Constitutional Amendments

8.7. All relevant permission holders must act to execute new versions of the Constitution by updating Pocket Core and/or relevant off-chain tools, platforms, or mechanisms, within 7 days, or else they will be removed from the permissions they hold.

#### Crediting Constitutional Amendments

8.8. Authors of constitutional amendments will be listed chronologically as authors of the Constitution.

#### Tracking Constitutional Amendments

8.9. Amendments which modify existing clauses will add a 0.01 increment to the Constitution version for every modification. Amendments which introduce/remove clauses will add a 0.1 increment to the Constitution version for every modification.

#### Upgrading the Council

8.10. Until an Aragon Agent (or similar smart contract representative) can own root permissions in the Council's existing platforms, the Foundation will hold these permissions and will therefore be responsible for any Council upgrades that have been approved in the PIP process.

8.11. If an upgrade involves introducing a new platform, which may use different addresses, the Foundation will be responsible for configuring the new platform, which Voters will join by re-staking their Governance Stake with their new addresses in the transaction memo.

### Pocket Core Amendments

8.12. Protocol Upgrades (including changes to the ACL) will be approved by the Council according to the PIP process.

8.13. Upgrades are pushed to Nodes in a dormant state then, once the Council has signaled approval, the Foundation will activate the upgrade retroactively by submitting a Governance Transaction.

8.14. Pocket Core's upgrade process is permissive. Node operators can keep pocket-runner on their Pocket Core installation if they consent to automatically updating their Nodes according to the Council's decisions. If they decide they want to refuse the Council's decisions, they can replace pocket-runner with their own versioning software and ignore Governance Transactions. This power is subject to a Tendermint consensus test, whereby 66%+ of the nodes must refuse the Council's decision in order for the blockchain to continue to operate normally without forking.

### Foundation Amendments

8.15. Because Supervisor decisions are not valid unless ratified by the Council, no upgrade can be made to the Foundation's Articles without the Council first signaling approval.

## 9. Initialization

9.1. No decision by the Council shall be legitimate until the founding Voters of the Council have unanimously approved this Constitution.

9.2. The following bootstrap measures will be in place until a Majority vote overrules them:
  * The Council shall use the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet;
  * All instances of Conviction Voting in the Constitution will be replaced by Majority Approval voting;
  * In all instances where Voters enforce this Constitution using Aragon Agreements, PNI will instead take on the responsibility using Aragon Approvals;
  * To reduce the friction of onboarding the first Voters, the Maturation Period for Governance Stakes will not be required.

9.3.
